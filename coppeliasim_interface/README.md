# CoppeliaSim interface with DQ Robotics: From zero to hero

A crash course on the interface with CoppeliaSim robot simulator.

All lessons are in MATLAB Live Script format, meaning that the coding is explained alongside the mathematical equations that they represent. At the end of each lesson, there is a homework section to help the reader internalize the concepts introduced in the lesson.

## How to use

1. Install [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
2. Download the latest version of the [DQ Robotics MATLAB Toolbox](https://github.com/dqrobotics/matlab/releases/latest).
2. Install the *DQ Robotics MATLAB Toolbox*.
   * (Windows) Double click the downloaded file. Follow the instructions.
   * (Linux etc) Browse to the toolbox file *within* MATLAB. Right click the toolbox file *within* MATLAB and choose *install*. Follow the instructions.
4. Clone this repository or [Download it as a ZIP package](https://github.com/dqrobotics/learning-dqrobotics-in-matlab/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
5. Install [CoppeliaSim](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/).
6. Download the [CoppeliaSim scenes](https://osf.io/2tfsx/) used in the lessons.
7. Open each lesson in MATLAB and follow through the live script.
